# Website Files

This folder contains the HTML files for your website (fireflydesigns.me).

## Files:
- `twitch.html` - Main page with "Add Bot" button
- `twitch-auth.html` - OAuth callback handler (needs Railway URL update)

## Setup:
1. **Generate Railway Domain**: In Railway dashboard, click "Generate Domain" button
2. **Get your Railway URL**: Will be something like `https://oauthmeow-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
3. **Update `twitch-auth.html`**: Replace `YOUR-RAILWAY-URL-HERE` with actual URL
4. **Upload both files** to fireflydesigns.me

## Next Steps:
1. Click "Generate Domain" in your Railway dashboard
2. Copy the generated URL
3. Update the auth file with the real URL
4. Upload to your website

## Note:
The auth page currently has a placeholder URL that needs to be updated with your actual Railway deployment URL.
